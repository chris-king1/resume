*CEO & Chief Science Officer at Oscar Newman*

I worked with Chris for over 10 years across multiple companies, locations, and roles. At PLATINUM technology and 
TrelliSoft Inc., I was his technical writing manager; at IBM, we lead the technical documentation efforts for enterprise-wide 
storage solutions. During this time, we worked closely together to deliver high-quality technical content to end users, in 
different formats and with multiple delivery methods.

Chris was the writer I depended on the most to get the most difficult tasks done, and to do them well. The work ethic, 
skills, and knowledge that he brought to writing projects were top notch, and his ability to adapt to sudden changes and 
new situations were invaluable for solving problems and meeting deadlines. His passion for technical writing and editing 
was contagious, and he never stopped trying to innovate and incorporate the latest writing techniques into his work and 
the work of other writers.

As a person, he is a pleasure to work with and very team focused. He's always willing to help and mentor others. He is 
even tempered, patient, and brings a positive attitude to every project. I enjoyed working with Chris very much and highly 
recommend him to any future employer.

*Senior Technical Writer at Capgemini*

Chris is a great technical writer with excellent editorial skills. His intense knowledge about the product had a great impact 
on the documentation. He's a man with golden heart and significant amount of patience. His contribution to IBM 
documentation is invaluable. My working experience with him is always memorable. 

He listens to queries with so much patience and gives suggestions without hurting others feelings and the given suggestions are pretty valuable.
Sometimes, though the situation is out of control, he still maintains that coolness without reacting too much to the 
situation. He responds to the situation on time, with the exact solution, and with what needs to be done. 

The people around Chris feels always comfortable. Chris brings great value to the organization. He knows the ins and outs of the 
product and he can answer us at anytime regarding any query. I always feel pleasure working with him and cherish the 
time spent with him. I learned a lot from him personally and professionally.

*Senior Software Engineer at IBM*

My experiences working with Chris have been fantastic. In the support organization, I am heavily reliant upon the 
technical product documentation we provide. I regularly reference it for customers to resolve their questions and 
concerns. Chris is always willing to listen to feedback and discuss opportunities for improvements. He's motivated, 
dependable, consistent, agile, and able to handle all kinds of technical material.

Chris also seeks out opportunities to find areas for improvement by joining conversations and really listening to the 
concerns that come from support, customers, and others in the field. He listens, iterates, and reviews to reach the best 
resolutions. He is genuinely interested in providing a good experience to our end users. Chris is one of the people I truly 
enjoy getting to work with.

*Senior Manager Technical Communications at HP Inc.*

I have previously worked with Chris at IBM as his information development manager for approximately 10 years. Chris 
worked in the role of senior technical writer, information architect and team lead during this period. Chris is really excellent
in designing and delivering information experience solutions which are laser focused towards the end user. He is very 
skilled in leveraging design thinking methodologies to ensure the documentation he develops aligns perfectly with the 
defined personas. Chris is very organised, efficient and structured in his approach to his own work and also the planning 
and coordination of the work required to be completed by the team as a whole. Chris has excellent collaboration skills and
he uses these capabilities very effectively to work closely with all key stakeholders across the business, including design, 
software development and product management. 

Chris also did great work in the area of promoting the product functionality he worked on via social media and IBM 
community forums and I believe this had a very positive impact from a sales and revenue perspective on these products. 
He is very much team focused and did great work in supporting, mentoring and training the other members of the team as
required. Chris is very conscientious and hardworking in everything he does and I found him very personable and easy to 
work with. 

I know that any employer will be very lucky to hire a person of the calibre of Chris and I am very happy to be able to give 
him this very strong recommendation.

*Level 3 scrum master at IBM for Storage Insights & Spectrum Control*

I've had the privilege of working closely with Chris for over a decade. He is an excellent writer who has proven time and 
again dedication to his craft, and to the customer. 

He is friendly, courteous, committed, and dependable. He is a leader and influencer. Plus he brings levity to the team, 
which is wonderful on a stressful project. 

He is meticulous in the accuracy and technical specifics of his documentation. He consistently goes beyond the scope of 
his tasks to ensure complete coverage in the docs. His depth of understanding and drive to be accurate has led him to 
uncover product defects missed by engineers, and Chris follows-thru to ensure the issues are resolved before product is 
released.

It's a pleasure to work with Chris!

Architect for our technical content and I worked closely with him for most of that period. Throughout that time, Chris 
demonstrated excellent writing and information organization skills. He was also very dedicated to his work and showed 
strong personal commitment to delivering the best possible solutions for our customers. I was regularly impressed with his
laser-like focus on the customer experience and success and his willingness to use innovative solutions to meet our

*Software Engineer at IBM*

I have worked with Chris at IBM from June 2009 to the present, primarily on the IBM Spectrum Control product and the 
IBM Storage Insights offering. 

We spent countless hours together enhancing the IBM Spectrum Control documentation and social media presence 
through approximately 35 - 40 releases/versions of the product. For the past 2 years, I have worked with Chris on the IBM
Storage Insights documentation, clarifying storage concepts for customers and ensuring technical accuracy.

Chris is outstanding on many levels. His writing and social media skills are magnificent. He has a strong work ethic, which
he balances with his wonderful personality and positive attitude, and this makes collaborating with Chris an absolute joy 
every day. Chris is a consummate professional - he works constantly to improve himself, he mentors/uplifts others in their 
information development and social media work, and he communicates openly and effectively at every turn. He is a great 
'team player' and is also fantastic when it comes to 'self directed' work.

I would gladly work with Chris again and again...and I unequivocally recommend him to any organization.

*Lead/Senior Technical Writer at Hitachi Vantara*

I worked with Chris for over 10 years at IBM and Capgemini. He is the best technical writer I have ever worked with. And I 
mean that sincerely. His writing and IA skills are fantastic, and so are his interpersonal skills. He is the total package. He 
knows tools, he's a leader, and his commitment is unparalleled. I have seen him single-handedly save entire projects with 
his dedication.

He is respected by his peers, his managers, and the stakeholders he works with. He is dedicated to exceeding customer 
needs whenever possible by implementing innovative solutions. If you are looking for someone who you do not need to 
manage at all and who makes your product shine, he's the writer for you.

*Senior Information Developer at IBM*

I worked with Chris at IBM for a number of years on the Spectrum Control and Storage Insights products. 

Chris was the information architect, team lead, and lead writer for these projects. 
I cannot recommend Chris highly enough. 
He is hard-working, conscientious, organized, and a great technical leader, writer and editor.

Chris is very easy to work with and a great motivator. He has a deep knowledge of the products and was always willing to 
share his knowledge and help other writers, regardless of how busy he was. 

Chris is also a great organiser and can quickly pivot to deal with customer issues that come in from left field. 

He’s a fantastic writer and I strongly recommend Chris to any organisation which values strong leadership, a great work 
ethic, and an agile, user-centered approach to delivery technical content.
