# Customer communication

View the customer communication that I wrote for a SaaS application. As the lead technical writer, I worked closely with DevOps to write emails and in-app notifications to address many conditions and events related to the application. These situations included customer onboarding, urgent news, nurture requests, security alerts, service interruptions, beta updates, important reminders, new releases, feature updates, and more. 

## In-app notification for a major update to the application

Subject line: Your [application name] service was updated!

Body: 

It’s that time again. We’ve updated [application name] with new capabilities to help you monitor your storage environment. To learn more about what's new in this update, see the [latest documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-insights?topic=whats-new). 

Tip: If automatic upgrade is not enabled for data collectors, ensure that you manually upgrade them so that you can benefit from all the new capabilities.
